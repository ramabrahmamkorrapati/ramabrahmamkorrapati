        <h3 >FRONT END DEVELOPMENT</h3>
        <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing <span style="color:lightsalmon"> HTML,CSS and JavaScript</span> for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

        <h3 >HTML</h3>
        <p>HTML <span style="color:tomato;"> (Hypertext Markup Language)</span> is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
            HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="red">
        <h3 >CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS <span style="color: lightsalmon;"> (Cascading Style Sheets) </span>is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
            Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
        </p>
    </div>

        <h3 >JAVA SCRIPT</h3>
        <p><span style="color: lightskyblue;">JavaScript</span> is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.
            JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

        <h3 >DOM</h3>
        <p>The <span style="color: mediumseagreen;">Document Object Model</span> (DOM) is an architecture that describes the structure of a document; each document is represented by an instance of the interface Document. A document, in turn, consists of a hierarchical tree of nodes, in which a node is a fundamental record representing a single object within the document (such as an element or text node)
            Nodes may be strictly organizational, providing a means for grouping other nodes together or for providing a point at which a hierarchy can be constructed; other nodes may represent visible components of a document. Each node is based on the Node interface, which provides properties for getting information about the node as well as methods for creating, deleting, and organizing nodes within the DOM
